# BridgeLabz_Stack-Queue

## Usecases
1. a. Ability to create a Stack of 56->30->70
   * Use LinkedList to do the Stack Operations
   * Here push will internally call add method on LinkedList.
   * So 70 will be added first then 30 and then 56 to make 56 on top of the Stack
  
   b. Ability to create a Queue of 56->30->70
   * Use LinkedList to do the Queue Operations
   * Here enqueu will internally call append method on LinkedList.
   * So 56 will be added first then 30 and then 70 to make 56 on top of the Queue


2. a. Ability to peak and pop from the Stack till it is empty 56 ->30 ->70. Use LinkedList to do the Stack Operations
   
   b. Ability to dequeue from the beginning. Use LinkedList to do the Queue Operations
